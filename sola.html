        "The eloquence of failure often times grabs the jugular of the reality of success in a man's life.
        Success more often than not likes to be seen when it's much needed to emphasize the truck load of work being put in daily.
        As such, it does not compete for attentions which are incosequential for progress and enhancing productivity."
